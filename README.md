# web-developer-quiz
A quiz testing web development knowledge.

## Description

This site is to showcase Carolina Ramirez Islas' work samples so that employers can assess if they want to collaborate with her.

A portfolio of work can showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights one's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

Flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables were some of the main components that were applied to this project for its success.
